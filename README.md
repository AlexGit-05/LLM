# LLM Tools and Scripts

A collection of Python scripts for working with Large Language Models (LLMs), including tools for text summarization, audio transcription with speaker diarization, and model fine-tuning.

## ü§î What are LLMs?
Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. These models can perform a wide range of tasks including:

Text generation and completion
Question answering
Summarization
Translation
Code generation
And much more

Popular examples include GPT-4, Claude, and Llama 2. These models have revolutionized natural language processing by demonstrating remarkable abilities to understand context and generate coherent, relevant responses.

## üîÑ Transformers: The Engine Behind LLMs

The Transformers architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need," is the fundamental architecture powering modern LLMs. Key features include:

Self-attention mechanism: Allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in context
Parallel processing: Enables efficient training on massive datasets
Bidirectional context: Considers both left and right context for better understanding
Transfer learning: Pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks

The Hugging Face Transformers library provides easy access to state-of-the-art transformer models and tools for working with them.

## ‚õìÔ∏è LangChain: Building LLM Applications

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides:

Chains: Combine LLMs with other processing steps
Agents: Create autonomous AI systems that can use tools
Memory: Manage conversation history and context
Prompt management: Template and optimize model inputs
Document processing: Handle various data formats and sources

LangChain makes it easier to build complex LLM applications by providing high-level abstractions and best practices.

## üí° QLoRA: Efficient Fine-tuning

QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique for efficiently fine-tuning large language models. Benefits include:

Reduced memory usage: Train large models on consumer GPUs
Preserved model quality: Maintain performance while reducing parameters
Fast adaptation: Quickly customize models for specific tasks
Cost-effective: Lower computational requirements for training

QLoRA makes it practical to adapt state-of-the-art models to specific use cases without extensive computational resources.
